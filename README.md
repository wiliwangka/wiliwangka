### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Hello! I'm William, a unique blend of creativity, adventure, and introspection. My world revolves around the fast-paced thrill of ping pong, the reflective art of personal blogging, and the immersive experience of Japanese novels. As an INFP, I thrive on exploring the depths of imagination and emotion, which is vividly expressed in my love for less-known manga, a treasure trove of unexplored stories.

### Snowboarding is my escape to the exhilarating outdoors, a perfect contrast to the quiet moments spent with a camera in hand, capturing life's fleeting moments through photography and film. My creative flair extends to the digital realm as well, where I design websites that are not just functional but also aesthetically pleasing. Each of these passions reflects a facet of my personality, together painting a picture of who I am - a person who finds joy in both the grand adventures and the simple pleasures of life.
